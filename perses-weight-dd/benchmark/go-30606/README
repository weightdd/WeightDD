Issue #30606 [0] reported a compiler bug with a runtime error with an attached
Go program as a reproducer. The reproducer was quite long, which makes it a
great test program for perses. The issue was fixed in CL [1] and merged into
the tree as commit [2]. The parent commit [3] was the last known commit that
could reproduce this issue.

To reduce the attached 30606.go program, checkout revision e269f4c of the Go
source code [4] and run the `make.bash` command to bootstrap and compile the
compiler. To use this custom go compiler, set your PATH variable:

$ export PATH=/path/to/cloned/go.googlesource.com/go/bin:$PATH

And check that you have the right go version:

$ go version
go version devel +1650f1ba0b Wed Mar 6 20:05:44 2019 +0000 linux/amd64

To run the bazel tests in this directory:

$ bazel test //benchmark/go-30606/...
