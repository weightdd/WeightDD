Issue #29220 [0] reported a internal compiler error with an attached Go program
as a reproducer. The issue was fixed in CL 154497 [1] and merged into the tree
as commit d924c33 [2]. The parent commit 213845f [3] was the last known commit
that could reproduce this issue.

To reduce the attached 29220.go program, checkout revision 213845f of the Go
source code [4] and run the `make.bash` command to bootstrap and compile the
compiler. To use this custom go compiler, set your PATH variable:

$ export PATH=/path/to/cloned/go.googlesource.com/go/bin:$PATH

And check that you have the right go version:

$ go version
go version devel +213845f7b9 Mon Dec 17 22:42:27 2018 +0000 linux/amd64

To run the bazel tests in this directory:

$ bazel test //benchmark/go-29220/...
