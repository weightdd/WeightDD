Issue #28390 [0] reported a internal compiler error with an attached Go program
as a reproducer. The issue was fixed in CL [1] and merged into the tree as
commit [2]. The parent commit [3] was the last known commit that could
reproduce this issue.

To reduce the attached 28390.go program, checkout revision [3] of the Go
source code [4] and run the `make.bash` command to bootstrap and compile the
compiler. To use this custom go compiler, set your PATH variable:

$ export PATH=/path/to/cloned/go.googlesource.com/go/bin:$PATH

And check that you have the right go version:

$ go version
go version devel +a361ef36af Sun Oct 28 18:17:46 2018 +0000 linux/amd64

To run the bazel tests in this directory:

$ bazel test //benchmark/go-28390/...
