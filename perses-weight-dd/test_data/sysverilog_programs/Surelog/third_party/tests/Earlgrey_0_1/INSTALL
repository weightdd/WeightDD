1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan
cd opentitan

2. Initialize env and install deps

pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r python-requirements.txt


3. run fusesoc

fusesoc --cores-root $(pwd) sim lowrisc:systems:top_earlgrey:0.1

The simulation will fail - icarus cannot handle the SV code, but FuseSoC will generate all the files we need. 

In the build/lowrisc_systems_top_earlgrey_0.1/sim-icarus directory you can find the lowrisc_systems_top_earlgrey_0.1.scr file listing all the sources used for simulating the design. 
The sources are collected in the build/lowrisc_systems_top_earlgrey_0.1/src directory.
Note that some sources are generated. Those can be found in the build/lowrisc_systems_top_earlgrey_0.1/sim-icarus/generated directory.
